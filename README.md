# Q3 Project Frontend

The backend repo for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/theycallmethetailor/chow-mein-backend/blob/master/README.md)

### Welcome to my q3 project.

For my project, I wanted to recreate a website for a local chinese restaurant I love and modernize things. The main thing I 
wanted to add that the current site doesn't have is online ordering functoinality. 

#### Frontend Technology used:

For the frontend side of this project, I wanted to challenge myself by using a framework not covered in this program, so I decided to use Vue.js rather than React. I used the Vue router, as well as Vuex. In addition, I used Vue.socket.io to handle the web socket functoinality for live updating the customer's order status, as well as auto-updating incoming orders on the admin side. 

 - Vue.js
 - Axios
 - Moment.js
 - Vue-socket.io
 - Vuetfiy
 - Vuelidate
 - Vuex
 - Node.js
