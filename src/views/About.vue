                  <p>Master Chef Michael Leung and his wife, Susan, opened Asian Cafe in the summer of 2005.   Michael was born in Hong Kong & trained under the country's best Cantonese Master Chef.  Michael is well known for introducing new & exciting dishes from Hong Kong and has been cooking authentic Chinese food in the Valley for almost 40 years. Michael, a Tai Chi Master, enjoys posting on Facebook, writing for the local

 Chinese newspaper and cooking up new specials to add to his 300+ item menu.</p>
                  <p>Susan is the heart of this operation.  Customers love coming to see her and just chat up.  Susan’s drink recipes are yummy and true to the traditional taste of old school Hong Kong Cafés.
